Could you describe information security?,"Information security is how companies protect 
their systems and information from threats. 
It can include the processes an organization follows 
to ensure security, the technology infrastructure and the roles that govern this area."
What is pentesting in your own words?,"Pentesting, or penetration testing, is a simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities. Pentesting is performed by ethical hackers, who use the same tools and techniques as malicious attackers, but with the permission of the target organization."
What are the different penetration phases?,"There are five penetration testing phases: 
reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting."
Reconnaissance,"In this phase, the tester gathers as much information about the target system as they can, 
including information about the network topology, operating systems and applications, 
user accounts, and other relevant information. "
Scanning,"Once all the relevant data has been gathered in the reconnaissance phase, 
it’s time to move on to scanning. In this penetration testing phase, 
the tester uses various tools to identify open ports 
and check network traffic on the target system."
Vulnerability Assessment,"the tester uses all the data gathered in the reconnaissance and scanning phases
 to identify potential vulnerabilities and determine whether they can be exploited. "
Exploitation,"In this penetration testing phase, the penetration tester attempts to access 
the target system and exploit the identified vulnerabilities, typically by using
 a tool like Metasploit to simulate real-world attacks."
Reporting,"Once the exploitation phase is complete, the tester prepares a report documenting 
the penetration test’s findings. The report generated in this final penetration testing 
phase can be used to fix any vulnerabilities found in the system
 and improve the organization’s security posture."
What are the different encryption types?,"Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are the two main types. 
Using keys, symmetric encryption means users and information owners 
can use the same key to encrypt or decrypt information. Assymetric means 
there's a private and public key to increase data protection for more sensitive information"
What makes a system vulnerable?,"Systems and programs are most vulnerable if they don't have additional security
 features like firewalls or advanced encryptions. In my last role, I pentested each 
new program we required, as they often lacked security features. 
This helped us identify what security measures we could implement to protect data."
Explain the OWASP Top 10,"The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the ten most critical web application security risks. 
These risks are commonly exploited by attackers. They include issues like Injection, 
Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more"
Black Box,Testers have no prior knowledge of the system. Simulates an external attacker.
White Box,Testers have full knowledge of the system's internals. Simulates an insider threat.
Grey Box,"Testers have partial knowledge, often provided by the client. Simulates a compromised insider."
Explain the CIA triad ,"The CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability"
Confidentiality,Ensuring that data is only accessible to authorized individuals.
Integrity, Ensuring that data is accurate and hasn't been tampered with.
Availability,Ensuring that data and systems are available when needed
Security Engineer,Focuses on designing and implementing security systems
Security Analyst:,"Analyzes security data, investigates incidents, and monitors for threats."
Security Architect,Designs the overall security structure and strategy of an organization.
What is CVSS?,"Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
is a framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities."
CVE,(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): Identifies and lists specific security vulnerabilities.
CWE,Identifies types of software weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilities.
Pentest Methodology/Standard,"The choice of methodology/standard depends on the specific project and client requirements.
 OWASP, OSSTMM, NIST, and ISSAF are all recognized frameworks."
Attack Vector,The means or path through which an attacker can exploit a vulnerability.
Attack Surface,The sum of all possible attack vectors in a system.
Injection,"This vulnerability occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter
 as part of a command or query. Common types include SQL injection
 and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers can manipulate input 
to execute malicious commands or scripts."
Broken Authentication,"Weak authentication mechanisms, such as using default credentials 
or not implementing proper session management, can lead to unauthorized access. 
Attackers may exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to user accounts."
Sensitive Data Exposure,"When sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers is not adequately protected,
 it can be exposed to attackers. This can happen through insecure storage, 
insufficient encryption, or other means."
XML External Entity (XXE),"XXE occurs when an application processes XML input without properly validating 
and protecting against external entity references. Attackers can use this to read local files,
 perform remote code execution, or launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),"XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data
 in web pages without proper validation. This can allow attackers 
to inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser."
Stored XSS,"The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server and served to users when 
they access a particular web page.
Example: Attacker posts a malicious script in a forum comment, 
and all visitors who view that comment are exposed to the script."
Reflected XSS,"The malicious script is embedded in a URL, email, or other input, 
and it's reflected off a web server to a user's browser.
Example: Attacker sends a phishing email containing a link with a malicious script. 
When the victim clicks the link, the script is executed in their browser."
DOM-Based XSS,"The attack occurs entirely on the client-side, with the malicious script manipulating the Document 
Object Model (DOM) of a web page.
Example: JavaScript on a web page reads a user's input and injects it into 
the DOM without proper validation, allowing for script execution."
Classic SQL Injection," Attackers insert malicious SQL queries into user input fields, 
often to extract or manipulate database data.
Example: A login form doesn't properly validate input, 
and an attacker enters ' OR '1'='1 as the username and password to bypass authentication."
Blind SQL Injection," Similar to classic SQL injection but without visible error messages. 
Attackers infer information by crafting queries that produce different responses.
Example: Attacker sends requests 
that ask true/false questions to the database to deduce sensitive information."
Time-Based Blind SQL Injection,"This is a variation of blind SQL injection where attackers delay
 the server's response to infer information.
Example: Attacker injects a query that causes a delay, 
and if the server's response time changes, they can infer whether a condition is true or false."
Out-of-Band SQL Injection,"Attackers retrieve data through an alternate channel 
(e.g., DNS requests or HTTP requests) rather than receiving 
the data in the web application's response.
Example: Malicious SQL queries trigger
 DNS requests that the attacker monitors to obtain extracted data."
Second-Order SQL Injection," Similar to blind SQL injection, but the payload isn't immediately executed.
 It's stored and executed later, potentially affecting a different user.
Example: Attacker injects SQL code that's stored in a database. 
When another user accesses the compromised data, the payload executes."

including private keys."
CVE-2016-5195," Dirty COW (Copy-On-Write), is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel. 
It's called ""dirty"" because it can be exploited by modifying read-only memory."
CVE-2021-44228," Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, 
a widely used logging utility in Java applications. It allows remote code execution."
CVE-2021-26855,"ProxyLogon is a vulnerability affecting Microsoft Exchange 2013, 2016, and 2019. 
It allows an adversary to bypass authentication and thus impersonate an administrator"
CVE-2020-1472,"critical Windows vulnerability allowing attackers on the 
same network to take control of a domain controller,"
OSSTMM,"Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual. 
This methodology focuses on measuring the security of a system. 
It  covers areas like information security, process security, and internet  security. 
It's more quantitative and aims to provide a comprehensive  assessment of security."
OWASP,"(Open Web Application Security Project): OWASP provides  a framework 
for testing web applications and services. It's known for  its ""Top Ten"" list of the most critical 
web application security risks,  which is regularly updated to reflect current threats."
NIST,"(National Institute of Standards and Technology): NIST  has published guidelines for conducting 
penetration testing. It  emphasizes the importance of defining the scope, objectives, 
and rules  of engagement for a penetration test."
PTES,"(Penetration Testing Execution Standard): PTES is a  comprehensive standard that defines
 a holistic approach to penetration  testing. It covers everything from scoping and intelligence 
gathering to  the final reporting phase."
CIS,"(Center for Internet Security): CIS provides guidelines  for conducting security assessments, 
which can include penetration  testing. Their focus is on best practices 
for securing systems and  networks."
ISSAF,"(Information Systems Security Assessment Framework):  
ISSAF is a framework that helps assess the security of information  systems. 
It includes various methodologies and tools for conducting  penetration tests."
What does bloodhound?,"BloodHound helps you visualize how attackers could move through an AD network 
if they were able to compromise certain user accounts or systems. 
It maps out the relationships and permissions between users, groups, and computers within the AD domain. 
By doing this, it can reveal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak points in the network's security."
Explain SCF File Attacks,"In an SCF file attack, the attacker creates a specially crafted SCF file that 
takes advantage of the way Windows handles these shortcut files. When the victim opens or even previews the SCF file, 
Windows automatically attempts to load icon resource information from it. 
This automatic behavior can be exploited by attackers to gather sensitive 
information like NTLMv2 hashes when the victim accesses the malicious SCF file over an SMB (Server Message Block) share"
CSRF,"CSRF, or Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an attack where an attacker tricks a user into unintentionally performing actions 
on a website without their knowledge or consent. This is typically done by getting the user to click on a malicious link or visit 
a website that contains malicious code. For example, let's say you're logged into your online banking account in one browser tab 
and you visit another website in a different tab. If the second website has malicious code, it could secretly send requests to 
your banking account in the background without you knowing. These requests might include transferring money or changing your password, 
all without your consent."
Vertical privilege escalation,"If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. For example, if a non-administrative user can gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation."
Horizontal privilege escalation,"Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type. For example, if an employee can access the records of other employees as well as their own, then this is horizontal privilege escalation."
